=head1 NAME

ppi_version - brian d foy's version of a Perl Parsing Interface version updater

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# call it like PPI::App::ppi_version
	% ppi_version show

	% ppi_version change 1.23 1.24

	# call it with less typing. With no arguments, it assumes 'show'.
	% ppi_version

	# with arguments that are not 'show' or 'change', assume 'change'
	% ppi_version 1.23 1.24

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ppi_version> looks for Perl files in the current directory and
subdirectories and extracts Perl versions.

To change versions, give the existing version that you want to target
and the version you want to change that too. B<ppi_version> does not
try to be smart about this like B<perlreversion> from L<Perl::VERSION>.
